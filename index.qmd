# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted nearly every aspect of society across the world, including educational performance. As students who experienced these challenges, we wanted to better understand how the pandemic affected student performance globally. In this project, we will analyze data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2018 and 2022 (before and after the pandemic) to explore changes in student performance. Our goal is to first measure the impact of the pandemic on education and identify contributing or confounding factors that may explain differences across countries. We also hope to examine how various countries’ responses to the pandemic in terms of education may have influenced their results.
