    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted nearly every aspect of society across the world, including educational performance. As students who experienced these challenges, we wanted to better understand how the pandemic affected student performance globally. In this project, we will analyze data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2018 and 2022 (before and after the pandemic) to explore changes in student performance. Our goal is to first measure the impact of the pandemic on education and identify contributing or confounding factors that may explain differences across countries. We also hope to examine how various countries’ responses to the pandemic in terms of education may have influenced their results.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur primary data source is the PISA dataset published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD is an international organization that develops standards that allow for more evidence based policies across the globe, including educational standards. Given its established reputation and collaboration with official governmental educational institutions, we believe this is a credible source.\nDisregarding a delay due to the pandemic, the PISA assessment is conducted once every three years and aims to evaluate the knowledge and skills of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science. By simulating real-world situations, the test aims to determine whether students can apply their knowledge rather than merely memorizing. The data is collected through a standardized testing approach with consistent administration environments in each country participating in the data collection. This ensures that it can be compared across countries.\nFor this project’s analysis, we will be using the PISA data from 2018 (pre-pandemic) and 2022 (post-pandemic) which are available on the published PISA reports on the OECD official website. The datasets are provided in XLSX formats with each file containing each country, their corresponding PISA scores, and country statistics (like GDP and education spending).\nIn the report, there are many different tables and datasets that are available for our use. We want to use the table where we have the average scores for each country, ranked from highest to lowest. PISA 2018 was last updated in December 2019, but there is no definite update date for PISA 2022, which we can assume to be sometime around the end of 2022.\nOne issue with the data is that though the OECD strives to maintain consistency across years, the pandemic caused various disruptions which, though documented clearly, could introduce noise into some cross country comparisons. However, this project is focusing on change from pre- to post-pandemic so cross country comparisons will be seldom made.\nSomething we want to be cognizant of is the fact that these scores might be fluctuating over the years due to other factors independent of the pandemic. To take care of this, we are planning to look into other data sources.\nData:\nhttps://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2018-results-volume-i_5f07c754-en.html\nhttps://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/pisa-2022-database.html\nBesides overarching global comparisons, we wanted to dive deeper into a few countries and analyze what actions they took regarding education during the pandemic and how that might explain their difference in PISA scores.\nFinland:\nFor Finland, we found various datasets in research papers looking for the effect of the pandemic on education in Finland.\nThe first paper we found was written by Harvard’s Department of Education and published in 2023. It provides several analyses of student/teacher engagement, burnout, and general attitudes throughout the pandemic.\nData:\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-42671-1_4\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-022-00518-1/tables/3\nOur second source is a report from the OECD which we’ve already explained is a highly credible source, and was published in December of 2020. This source puts together several data sources that discuss the actions Finland took to switch to distance learning and the impact of them.\nData:\nhttps://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-policy-outlook/covid-snapshot-Finland.pdf\nUnited States:\nIn addition to Finland, we decided to look into data from the US. Google has health data for COVID-19 that is credible and verified. It is one of the largest collections of COVID data available to use, compiled from various sources. Through this dataset, we can examine how the different factors, such as socioeconomic factors, can affect how the virus affected various groups of people, giving us a better understanding of the effects of the pandemic.\nData: https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data\nThe 2021-2022 School Learning Modalities dataset contains information about the learning modality for primary and secondary schools. The data was aggregated from multiple data sources to determine the likely learning modality of the school district. The data was provided by the CDC.\nData: https://healthdata.gov/National/School-Learning-Modalities-2021-2022/aitj-yx37/about_data\nThe final dataset is from the National Center for Education Statistics and it is data regarding the U.S. education at the time of COVID. There’s a variety of data regarding the activities of people during this time, such as the number of adults with children who had their students attending summer programs or working with private tutors. We hope to use this data to gain more data about the ways students and parents coped with the changes in education during this turbulent time.\nData: https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/annualreports/topical-studies/covid/\nOther Sources for analysis:\nhttps://healthdata.gov/browse?q=school+learning+modalities&sortBy=relevance&pageSize=20 https://www.aecf.org/blog/pandemic-learning-loss-impacting-young-peoples-futures#:~:text=A:%20After%20the%20shift%20to,were%20prepared%20to%20pursue%20careers. https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/dstr/pdf/YRBS_Data-Summary-Trends_Report2023_508.pdf https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/dstr/pdf/trendsreport.pdf https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/index.html https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/index.html https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/index.html",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThe OECD manages the PISA exam all over the world, but each country must elect to participate. For a plethora of reasons, countries might not elect to participate, so not all countries participate in every PISA test. In order to model that, we created an alluvial plot to see how many countries participate and in which tests.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = participation_df,\n       aes(axis1 = `2009`, axis2 = `2012`, axis3 = `2015`, axis4 = `2018`, axis5=`2022`)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = total_participated), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_stratum(alpha = 0.9) +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 3) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"2009\", \"2012\", \"2015\", \"2018\", \"2022\"), \n                   expand = c(0.15, 0.05)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Country Participation Over Time\",\n       y = \"Number of Countries\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, we can see that a majority of the participating countries participate every year, which is good for some long-term analysis. The next largest group seems to be countries that have participated in 2 tests, and most of those countries either participated in just the first two (2009 and 2012) or the last two (2018 and 2022). There are also several countries that have only participated once, and those countries are pretty evenly split on which test they participated in.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\ncountry_counts &lt;- participation_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(country) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count_status = n(), .groups = 'drop') \n\nname_fix &lt;- c(\n  \"United States\" = \"United States of America\",\n  # The following must be explicitly named:\n  \"Hong Kong-China\" = \"China\", \n  \"Shanghai-China\" = \"China\",\n  \"Chinese Taipei\" = \"China\",\n  \"South Korea\" = \"Korea, Republic of\",\n  \"North Korea\" = \"Korea, Democratic People's Republic of\",\n  \"Iran\" = \"Iran, Islamic Republic of\",\n  \"Vietnam\" = \"Viet Nam\",\n  \"Egypt\" = \"Egypt, Arab Republic of\",\n  \"Czech Republic\" = \"Czechia\",\n  \"Syria\" = \"Syrian Arab Republic\",\n  \"Bolivia\" = \"Bolivia (Plurinational State of)\",\n  \"Brunei Darussalam\" = \"Brunei\",\n  \"Slovak Republic\" = \"Slovakia\",\n  \"Korea\" = \"Korea, Republic of\", \n  \"Baku (Azerbaijan)\" = \"Azerbaijan\",\n  \"Moldova\" = \"Republic of Moldova\", \n  \"Kosovo\" = \"Kosovo\")\n\ncountry_counts$country_fixed &lt;- recode(country_counts$country, \n                                       !!!name_fix, .default = \n                                         country_counts$country)\n\n\nworld &lt;- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nworld_data &lt;- world %&gt;%\n  left_join(country_counts, by = c(\"name\" = \"country_fixed\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(count_status_factor = factor(count_status))\n\n\nmap_pisa &lt;- ggplot(world_data) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = count_status_factor), color = \"white\", size = 0.1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\", \n                       na.value = \"gray90\",\n                       name = \"Number of Times\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Times a Country Took the Pisa Test\",\n    fill = \"count_status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # Optional: Clean up map theme\n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"transparent\")\n  )\n\nmap_pisa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most significant insight is that the massive amount of gray (“NA”) data is not random, but systematic. Missingness largely correlates with lower-income nations (most of Africa, Central Asia, and parts of the Middle East). PISA is expensive and complex. The countries that need standardized educational assessment data the most are often the ones that cannot afford to participate. This creates a global knowledge gap, where comparative educational research is heavily biased toward the wealthier, developed world (OECD members and partners). Any “global” trend analysis drawn from this map is inherently incomplete.\nCountries colored deep blue (participated only once) are “partially” missing from the trend analysis. A single data point provides a snapshot but fails to reveal the long-term impact of educational reforms, which requires sustained participation. The gray areas indicate educational research exclusion and data inequality.\nThere are also reports of certain countries (like India - Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh) that took the test once and were shocked by the nation’s poor performance. Therefore, they stopped participating in the tests.\n\n2.2.1 Lack of NANs\nFortunately, this dataset was relatively clean and required minimal pre-processing. This is probably because there is a specific focus on a single statistic, PISA scores across multiple years. The structured nature of the PISA data means that the presence or absence of a value in one column is independent of values in other columns, eliminating complex dependency issues (the absence of a test score doesn’t indicate the absence of a demographic variable).",

    "text": "3.1 Global Educational Trends\nLet’s now take a look at the PISA data:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(all_scores_long, \n       aes(x = score, \n           y = fct_reorder(as.factor(year), year, .desc = TRUE)\n           )) +\n  geom_density_ridges(fill = \"blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Overall PISA Scores Over Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Year\") +\n  xlab(\"Score\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, the distribution is slightly bimodal, with a shallow peak centered at score = 425 and a taller peak at score = 475. As the years pass, the peaks are slowly becoming closer in size. We cannot determine exactly what is changing, but some explanations could be that:\n\nCountries from the “right peak” are getting worse scores, thus becoming a part of the left peak\nThe different countries that are participating each year have different distributions of scores, and so their participation/lack thereof changes the overall distribution we see\n\nThe second explanation is less likely since we do see a trend, and there is a low possibility that the participation/non-participation of countries each year created a very clear trend. However, let’s test this out by looking at each country’s individual change.\n\n\nCode\n# \nall_scores_long |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 2017) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(score)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = score, \n             y = fct_reorder2(country, year==\"2022\", score, .desc=FALSE), \n             color=as.factor(year))) +\n  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=3) +\n  ggtitle(\"PISA Scores in 2018 vs. 2022\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  theme_linedraw() + \n  labs(color = \"Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries with scores below 450 have not greatly changed their PISA scores, as shown by the overlapping 2018 and 2022 points. The countries with scores greater than 450 do not have overlapping points; thus, their scores have changed. Looking closer, we see that the 2022 dots are mostly to the left of the 2018 dots, indicating that their scores went down. This supports the idea that higher-scoring countries are scoring worse and thus moving to the lower peak.\nWe now know that, at least from 2018 to 2022, the PISA scores decreased. Let’s check the entire trend.\n\n\nCode\n# Plotting scores\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = filter(all_reading_scores_long, year &gt; 2010), \n             aes(x=year, y=score, color = \"Individual Countries\"), \n             position='jitter') +\n  geom_point(data = filter(all_reading_scores_long, country == \"OECD average\"), \n             aes(x = year, y = score, color = \"OECD Average\"), \n             size = 4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Individual Countries\" = \"black\", \n                                \"OECD Average\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2012, 2015, 2018, 2022)) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"PISA Reading Scores\") +\n  ggtitle(\"PISA Reading Scores from 2012-2022\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = filter(all_math_scores_long, year &gt; 2010), \n             aes(x=year, y=score, color = \"Individual Countries\"), \n             position='jitter') +\n  geom_point(data = filter(all_math_scores_long, country == \"OECD average\"), \n             aes(x = year, y = score, color = \"OECD Average\"), \n             size = 4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Individual Countries\" = \"black\", \n                                \"OECD Average\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2012, 2015, 2018, 2022)) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"PISA Math Scores\") +\n  ggtitle(\"PISA Math Scores from 2012-2022\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = filter(all_science_scores_long, year &gt; 2010), \n             aes(x=year, y=score, color = \"Individual Countries\"), \n             position='jitter') +\n  geom_point(data = filter(all_science_scores_long, country == \"OECD average\"), \n             aes(x = year, y = score, color = \"OECD Average\"), \n             size = 4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Individual Countries\" = \"black\", \n                                \"OECD Average\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2012, 2015, 2018, 2022)) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"PISA Science Scores\") +\n  ggtitle(\"PISA Science Scores from 2012-2022\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout the context of previous years, we wouldn’t have known that every year, all PISA scores have been dropping slowly. This graph shows that the scores are slowly decreasing over time. However, it is difficult to see whether the 2022 scores are significantly lower than the trend.

For reading and math, there is, unsurprisingly, a clear difference between the predicted and actual scores; the true 2022 scores were much lower than the predicted. One shock was that science scores in 2022 were actually better than expected.\nGiven only three data points, it is difficult to conclude a significant difference for 2022; however, these data points are summarized from the millions of students globally who took the exam. Though we do not have several years of data, the data we do have summarizes millions of data points, which should give some assurance to the credibility of the plot. The “models” created had no intention of predicting future values accurately; they serve as a visual representation of how large a jump in scores there is from before the pandemic to after.\nBased on these graphs, we can conclude that there was a dip in educational outcomes from 2018 to 2022.\n\n3.1.1 Other factors\nWe’ve shown there was a dip from 2018 to 2022, and although the pandemic was the most significant event during that time, there is no guarantee that it was the only factor causing the dip. Let’s take a look at some other factors.\nOne major indicator of education outcomes is educational expenditure.\n\n\nCode\ncountries_to_label &lt;- c(\n  \"United States\",\n  \"Japan\",\n  \"Qatar\",\n  \"Greece\",\n  \"Indonesia\",\n  \"Germany\",\n  \"Australia\",\n  \"Romania\",\n  \"Finland\",\n  \"Singapore\",\n  \"Luxembourg\",\n  \"Cyprus\",\n  \"Panama\")\n\n# Load and Prepare Data 2018\npisa_Spending2018 &lt;- inner_join(\n  read.csv(\"data/2018_GDP.csv\"),\n  read.csv(\"data/2018_Spending.csv\"),\n  by = \"Country\"\n) |&gt;\n  select(Country, Score, Spending) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Score = as.numeric(Score),\n    Spending = as.numeric(Spending)\n  )\n\npisa_points_2018 &lt;- pisa_Spending2018 |&gt;\n  filter(Country != \"OECD average\")\n\noecd_avg_score_2018 &lt;- pisa_Spending2018 |&gt;\n  filter(Country == \"OECD average\") |&gt;

Some outliers do exist, indicating that spending is not the only indication of higher scores. Qatar spends significantly more money per student, but its students do not score higher than even the OECD average. But overall, we can conclude that there is a positive correlation between PISA scores and educational spending.\nEducational expenditure by each country is based on several factors, including the country’s general wealth.

We can connect this correlation to the previous graphs regarding GDP per capita and educational expenditure. If a country has more money to spare and is doing well economically, then it has more resources for education. If there are more resources, then students are better prepared for exams such as PISA, and will therefore perform well on the exam.\nSome specifics: We can see that from 2018-2022, Singapore’s GDP per capita and PISA scores increased. However, the United States saw an increase in GDP per Capita and a decrease in PISA scores. In the plots above comparing GDP and spending on education, we see that the USA spends generously on its students’ education. Other factors, including the emotional stress of the pandemic, could have yielded lower scores despite the economic resurgence by 2022.\nWe found that educational spending and GDP per capita are also factors in PISA outcomes. Educational spending also depends heavily on GDP, and we know GDP took a dip during the pandemic. Thus, several typical factors for educational outcomes were also affected by the pandemic. We cannot guarantee the pandemic is the sole cause of the educational dip from 2018 to 2022, but several other factors to educational outcomes were also affected by the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic likely had the largest effect.",

This aligns with the previous PISA score graphs for all countries, which also showed a significant dip from 2018 to 2022. From the cynicism and burnout plots, we can hypothesize that students felt more cynical due to their lockdown lives and burnt out by the strain of living through the global pandemic.\nThe transition to distance learning during the pandemic led to decreased engagement among students, teachers, and principals. This shift significantly increased stress and burnout for educators, with principals feeling the effects of their teachers’ struggles. Teachers found it difficult to compensate for the inconsistent support students received back home. Students were not getting the support that they needed.\nConclusion: The switch to distance learning was well-organized, but it ultimately worsened fairness in education and removed the conditions students needed to learn and feel supported.\n\n\n3.2.2 USA\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"data/school_modality.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Learning_Modality = as.factor(Learning_Modality),\n    Year = as.factor(Year))\n\ncounts &lt;- df |&gt;\n  group_by(Year, Learning_Modality) |&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = sum(Count), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ntbl &lt;- xtabs(Freq ~ Year + Learning_Modality, data = counts)\n\ncolors_theme &lt;- c(\"#FFB6B9\", \"#FAE3D9\", \"#61C0BF\")\n\nmosaic(\n  tbl,\n  direction = c(\"v\", \"h\"),\n  highlighting = \"Learning_Modality\",\n  highlighting_fill = colors_theme,\n  main = \"Learning Modality by Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create this mosaic plot, we used the “K-12 public and independent charter school districts for the 2021-2022 school year and the Fall 2022 semester, from August 2021 – December 2022” data. From 2020 to 2022, the USA changed learning modality due to the pandemic. According to the mosaic plot above, the majority of schools were either in-person or hybrid. By the end of 2022, almost all schools went back to in-person. Considering the severity of the pandemic, the percentage of in-person and hybrid schools is worrisome. It does not seem like the U.S. was proactive in moving schools to remote learning for the sake of safety.\nIt is true that the U.S. was able to get most schools to be remote, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. However, many schools took some time to implement this, due to backlash from the public about the effects of remote learning, as well as whether COVID was dangerous enough to make such a drastic decision regarding education.\n\n\nCode\nusaburnout &lt;- read.csv(\"data/USA_burnout.csv\")\n\nusaburnout$Year &lt;- as.numeric(usaburnout$Year)\n\nusaburnout_train &lt;- subset(usaburnout, Year &lt;= 2019)\n\nburnout_model &lt;- lm(High_School ~ Year, data = usaburnout_train)\n\nprediction_year &lt;- data.frame(Year = 2021)\npredicted_value &lt;- predict(burnout_model, newdata = prediction_year)\n\npredicted_point &lt;- data.frame(\n  Year = 2021, \n  High_School = predicted_value,\n  Type = \"Predicted\"\n)\n\nactual_points &lt;- usaburnout\nactual_points$Type &lt;- \"Actual (2007-2019)\"\nactual_points[actual_points$Year == 2021, \"Type\"] &lt;- \"Actual (2021)\"\n\nggplot(data = actual_points, aes(x = Year, y = High_School)) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"rect\",\n    xmin = 2020, \n    xmax = 2022, \n    ymin = -Inf, \n    ymax = Inf,\n    fill = \"grey\", \n    alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n\n  geom_smooth(\n    data = usaburnout_train, \n    method = \"lm\", \n    se = FALSE, \n    color = \"darkgreen\", \n    linetype = \"dashed\", \n    linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Type), size = 3) + \n\n  geom_point(\n    data = predicted_point, \n    aes(color = Type), \n    size = 4, \n    shape = 17 \n  ) +\n  \n  geom_segment(\n    aes(\n      x = 2019, \n      y = actual_points[actual_points$Year == 2019, \"High_School\"], \n      xend = 2021, \n      yend = predicted_point[predicted_point$Year == 2021, \"High_School\"]\n    ),\n    linetype = \"dotted\",\n    color = \"darkgreen\",\n    linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  \n  expand_limits(y = 0) + \n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Student Burnout (Persistent Sadness) Trends: USA\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\n      \"Linear Prediction for 2021: \", round(predicted_value, 2), \n      \"% (Actual: \", actual_points[actual_points$Year == 2021, \n                                   \"High_School\"], \"%)\"\n    ),\n    y = \"Percent of Students (%)\",\n    x = \"Year\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"Data Point\",\n    values = c(\n      \"Actual (2007-2019)\" = \"black\", \n      \"Actual (2021)\" = \"red\", \n      \"Predicted\" = \"blue\"\n    )\n  ) +\n\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also observe a sharp jump in the percentage between 2019 and 2021.

We can conclude the same things we did for Finland, with students feeling very cynical about their lives and burnt out by the strain that came from surviving a global pandemic, hence the drop in scores. According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, in the U.S., the abrupt transition to remote learning significantly disrupted student education by reducing instructional time and engagement, leading to difficulties with focus and a reluctance to seek help. This shift was also caused by a digital divide, which negatively affected marginalized students because of unequal internet access, increasing dropout rates. There was a widespread mental health crisis, marked by higher rates of stress, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, teachers continuously had to rapidly adjust and trim their curricula due to limited time.",

    "text": "Overall, we have established that COVID-19 impacted education in several significant ways, both directly and indirectly. Through the various plots, we were able to see that the amount of money spent on education and the country’s overall economic performance (measured in GDP per capita) were somewhat of an indicator as to whether the country’s PISA scores were high or not. Moreover, we saw trends in overall student well-being by comparing the data from 2018 to 2022. There were obvious decreases there, hence suggesting that COVID might have been a reason. This is further proven by the linked articles about society and education during that tumultuous time. Some limitations in our analysis were that we did not have similar “percentage of burnt out students” data for other countries, which would have been an interesting thing to investigate. Perhaps we could also further our investigation by looking into more 3rd world countries. However, many of those countries have not taken the PISA, which is something that we cannot control or supplement with other scores. We could definitely look into other metrics (such as the SAT) and see whether that changes our conclusions.",
