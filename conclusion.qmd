# Conclusion

Overall, we can see that COVID did impact education in some significant ways, some direct, and some indirect. Through the various plots, we were able to see that the amount of money spent on education and the country's overall economic performance (measured in GDP per capita) was somewhat of an indicator as to whether the country's PISA scores were high or not. In addition, we saw trends in overall student well-being by comparing the data from 2018 to 2022. There were obvious decreases there, hence suggesting that COVID might have been a reason. This is further proven by the linked articles about society and education during that tumultuous time. Some limitations in our data was that we didn't have much data about the percent of burned out students for other countries, which would have been an interesting thing to investigate. Perhaps we could also further our investigation by looking into more 3rd world countries. However, a lot of countries don't even take the PISA, which is something that we cannot control. We could definitely look into other metrics (such as the SAT) and see whether that changes our conclusions.
